## Company Overview
Cyclistic, launched in 2016, has quickly become a prominent bike-share service in Chicago, offering a fleet of over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. The program distinguishes itself by providing not only traditional two-wheeled bikes but also inclusive options like reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes to cater to riders with diverse needs. Cyclistic aims to be both a convenient commuting option and a leisure activity provider, with about 30% of users commuting daily.

## Project Scenario
As a member of Cyclistic's marketing analytics team, I was tasked with exploring how different customer segments—casual riders and annual members—use our bikes. This analysis aimed to uncover insights that could help convert casual riders into annual members, aligning with the company's goal to boost long-term membership and revenue.

## Objectives
The project was driven by three primary questions:
- How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
- Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
- How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Tools
- MySql - Data cleaning and manipulating
  - See my code [here]()
- Tableau - Data visulation
  - See my dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/CourseaBikeCase/FinalDashboard?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Key Findings
The analysis revealed distinct usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. For instance, casual riders tend to take longer rides during weekends and holidays, while annual members often use the bikes for shorter, routine commutes. These insights suggested targeted marketing strategies to appeal to casual riders' preferences and lifestyle.

## Recommendations
Based on the findings, I proposed the following strategies to increase annual memberships:

- Develop weekend and holiday promotions to attract casual riders.
- Highlight the convenience and cost savings of annual memberships for regular users.
- Utilize digital media campaigns to emphasize the exclusive benefits and flexibility of being an annual member.

## Limitations 
As one month's worth of data already exceeds the maximum rows that both Excel and Google Sheets can handle, I chose MySQL to merge all 12 months of data and clean the data.




## Conclusion
This project underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making in marketing strategy. By understanding user behavior and preferences, Cyclistic can effectively tailor its marketing efforts to convert more casual riders into loyal annual members. This case study not only highlights my analytical skills but also my ability to translate data insights into practical business recommendations.
